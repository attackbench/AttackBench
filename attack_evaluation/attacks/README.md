# Adding an attack

To add an attack that can be called through the sacred CLI, you need to implement two functions.

### Config function

The first function will be the named config and should follow the template:

```python
def <library


prefix > _ < config
name > ():
name = '<name of the attack>'
source = '<name of the library>'
threat_model = '<name of the threat model>'
option1 = 0.01
```

The library prefix corresponds to a shorter version of the library name; for instance, Foolbox's prefix is `fb`.
All other variables of the config function will correspond to the attack's option.
This function should be placed in the `<library>/configs.py` file.

### Getter function

The second function to implemented is the getter function, which will return the attack as a callable. This getter
function should follow the template:

```python
def get_<


    library
prefix > _ < attack
name > (option1: float) -> Callable:
return ...
```

The `<attack name>` in the name of the getter function should match exactly the name of the attack in the config
function: `name = <attack name>`. This is necessary to determine which getter function to call when calling a named
config.

### Example

In `foolbox/configs.py`, the DDN attack is added with the two functions:

```python
def fb_ddn():
    name = 'ddn'
    source = 'foolbox'
    threat_model = 'l2'
    init_epsilon = 1
    num_steps = 100
    gamma = 0.05


def get_fb_ddn(init_epsilon: float, num_steps: int, gamma: float) -> Callable:
    return partial(DDNAttack, init_epsilon=init_epsilon, steps=num_steps, gamma=gamma)
```

Additionally, one could add a second named config for DDN by simply implementing a second config function:

```python
def fb_ddn_large_gamma():
    name = 'ddn'
    source = 'foolbox'
    threat_model = 'l2'
    init_epsilon = 1
    num_steps = 100
    gamma = 0.5
```

This second named config would point to the same getter function.
